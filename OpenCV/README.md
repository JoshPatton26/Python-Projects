# OpenCV Basics

This repository serves as a collection of projects and code snippets that showcase various image and video processing techniques, corner detection algorithms, object detection algorithms, color detection, and face detection using cascading classifiers. All examples are implemented using the powerful OpenCV library in Python.

## Projects

### Image Processing and Modification
Explore a variety of image processing techniques, including filtering, transformations, and color manipulation. These examples showcase how to enhance and modify images using OpenCV.

### Video Processing and Modification
Learn how to process and manipulate videos using OpenCV. From basic video editing to more advanced tasks like video stabilization, these examples provide insights into working with video streams.

### Corner Detection Algorithm
Discover corner detection algorithms that help identify key points in an image. Explore methods like Harris corner detection to detect corners, which are often used in applications like image stitching and tracking.

### Object Detection Algorithm
Learn about object detection algorithms that can identify and locate objects within an image. Examples include using techniques like contour detection and template matching to detect specific objects.

### Color Detection
Implement a color detection program that identifies and isolates specific colors within an image. This project demonstrates how to use color spaces and thresholding techniques for color segmentation.

### Face Detection Algorithm using Cascading Classifiers
Dive into face detection using cascading classifiers, a widely used technique that allows for real-time face detection. Learn how to train classifiers and apply them for tasks like face recognition and emotion detection.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a specific project or example. You can navigate into these directories to find the corresponding Python scripts and any associated data files. To run an example, make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed, then execute the script using the following steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoshPatton26/OpenCV-Basics.git
    ```

2. Navigate to Repository:

    ```bash
    cd OpenCV-Basics
    ```

3. Install OpenCV Library:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install opencv-python
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python -m pip3 install opencv-python
    ```

4. Run Python File:

    ```bash
    python imagestuff.py
    ```

    If you have more than one webcam, you might need to edit the `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` argument to find the integer value that represents where your camera is accessible.

I hope these OpenCV examples provide you with valuable insights and practical experience in image processing and computer vision. Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and adapt them for your own applications!
