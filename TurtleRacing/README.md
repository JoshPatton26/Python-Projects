# Turtle Racing Game

The Turtle Racing Game is a Python program that simulates a race between multiple turtles. Each turtle is represented by a colored turtle graphic on the screen. The turtles move forward randomly until one of them crosses the finish line, and the program announces the winner.

## Description

The Turtle Racing Game provides an entertaining way to learn about Python's turtle graphics module and basic game development concepts. By creating a visual race between turtles and utilizing random movement, the game engages users and demonstrates simple animation and event handling in Python.

## Features

- Generates a user specified number of turtles to race (2 - 10).
- Utilizes Python's turtle graphics module to display racing turtles on the screen.
- Randomly moves each turtle forward until one crosses the finish line.
- Announces the winner of the race.

## Learning Objectives

- Explore Python's turtle graphics module for simple animation.
- Understand basic game development concepts such as random movement and event handling.
- Practice programming skills through creating a fun and interactive game.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `turtle_racing_game.py`).
3. Run the Python file using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the number of racers (2-10).
5. Watch as the turtles race across the screen.
6. Once a turtle reaches the finish line, the program will announce the winner.
