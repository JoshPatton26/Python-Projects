# Aim Trainer

Aim Trainer is a Python program built with the pygame module. It creates a game environment where random targets appear on the screen for the user to test their aiming skills. This project serves as an excellent opportunity to understand the concept of classes in Python and the practical applications of the pygame library.

## Features
- Randomly generated targets to challenge the user's aim.
- Real-time tracking of user stats such as time, speed, hits, and remaining lives.
- End game screen displaying detailed statistics including time played, hit rate, and accuracy.

## Learning Objectives
- **Classes in Python:** The project utilizes classes to create and manage target objects efficiently. This demonstrates how classes can encapsulate data and behavior, providing a clean and organized structure for the code.
  
- **Pygame Module:** Aim Trainer showcases the capabilities of the pygame module for creating interactive games in Python. It demonstrates how pygame can handle graphics, input events, and game logic to develop engaging applications.
