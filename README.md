# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This repository houses a diverse collection of projects, including assignments from my Probability and Statistics in Computer Science course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), personal projects developed in my free time, and various other Python-based endeavors.

## Project Overview

### Probability and Statistics Assignments
This section contains assignments from my Probability and Statistics in CS course at UAB. These assignments cover a range of topics in probability theory, statistical analysis, data visualization, and more. Each assignment provides practical experience in applying mathematical concepts to real-world datasets using Python.

### Password Manager
In addition to course projects, this repository includes a password manager application developed during my free time. The password manager offers secure storage of passwords using encryption techniques and provides functionalities for password generation, storage, and retrieval.

### CSV Data Parsing and Filtering Project
Another project in this repository involves parsing and filtering data from a CSV file. This project demonstrates proficiency in file handling, data manipulation, and filtering techniques using Python.

### OpenCV Projects
This section showcases projects developed using the OpenCV library, which is widely used for computer vision tasks. These projects may include image processing, object detection, face recognition, and more, providing hands-on experience in computer vision applications.

### Graphing and Plotting Project
This section involves displaying graphing and plotting in Python. This project explores various Python libraries for data visualization, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, to create informative and visually appealing plots and graphs.

## Development Environment

### Tools and Libraries
All projects in this repository were developed using Python programming language along with various libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and more. Text editors Visual Studio Code were used for coding and development.

## Running the Projects

Each project directory contains instructions on how to set up and run the code. Depending on the project, you may need to install additional Python libraries using pip. Please refer to the project's README for specific setup instructions.

## Contributing

If you encounter any issues with the projects or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome, whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or optimizing code.
