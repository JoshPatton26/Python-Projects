CS355 Probability and Statistics in CS: Project 3 Layover Flight Simulator

In this assignment I was tasked to create a program that would simulate two different airlines
layover flights from A to D. For this program we were told to work in groups and split up the 
work accordingly. I was grouped with Vaishak Menon, a classmate from UAB.

The assignment had you start at A which has one flight to B, depending on the time that you arrive 
at B will determine which of the two flights you will catch to go from B to C, once again, depending 
on the time you arrive to C will determine which of the three flights you will take from C to D. 
Flight times were determined by using a normal random variable using the values of the mean and 
standard deviation, both values were provided in the assignment PDF. To generate these I used the 
build in random.normal function. These values were bounded by a min and max that was provided in the
assignment PDF to help make it more realistic with the rare extreme values produced by this function.
If the persons flight took longer than expected and caused them to miss all the next flights for the
upcoming destination, they were considered stranded. The assignment then asked up to answer questions
based off our results.

To see the questions that we were asked and to get more information about the program expectations
and calculations, please refer to Program III.pdf in this repository.

To run this program you might have to pip install python's "numpy.random" library to get the program 
to function properly. I ran mine on VS Code however it shouldn't have any issues running on any other 
IDE, but hasn't been tested.
