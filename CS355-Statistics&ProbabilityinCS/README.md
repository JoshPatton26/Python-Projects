# ProbabilityAndStatisticsinCS

<h3> Introduction </h3>
This repository compiles the coursework completed during the Probability and Statistics in Computer Science course at UAB. The course aimed to bridge the gap between probability and statistics concepts and their practical application in computer science scenarios. The coursework includes both individual homework assignments and group projects that involve hands-on coding and analysis.

<h3> Course Highlights </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Exploration of various probability distributions and statistical measures.
    <li>Application of probability and statistics in computer science contexts.
    <li>Collaborative projects to solve real-world problems using statistical analysis.
    <li>Implementation of algorithms and simulations to model probabilistic events.
</ul>

<h2> Projects </h2>
<h3> Card Shuffling Probability Calculator </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Team: Joshua Patton, Vaishak Menon
    <li>Description: This project involved implementing different card shuffling methods and calculating the probabilities of obtaining specific card arrangements after shuffling. The project aimed to deepen the understanding of probability concepts through a concrete example.
</ul>

<h3> Layover Flight Simulator </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Team: Joshua Patton, Vaishak Menon
    <li>Description: The layover flight simulator project focused on analyzing flight layover times and predicting the likelihood of missing connecting flights. By simulating various scenarios and incorporating statistical analysis, the project provided insights into optimizing travel itineraries.
</ul>

<h2> Homework Assignments </h2>
<h3> Poker Hand Simulator </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Description: A Python program to simulate poker hands and calculate the probabilities of different hand ranks, helping to reinforce the concepts of probability distributions and combinations.
</ul>

<h3> Riemann Sum Calculator </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Description: An implementation of Riemann sum calculations using Python, illustrating the integration of statistics into numerical analysis and approximation techniques.
</ul>

<h3> Wait Time Prediction </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Description: A program that predicts wait times based on historical data, applying regression analysis to real-world scenarios and demonstrating the utility of statistical modeling.
</ul>

<h3> Usage </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>All code has been altered to be different from the actual course work, intended for educational purposes ONLY.
    <li>Each project and homework folder contains the relevant Python files and any associated resources or documentation.
    <li>Feel free to explore the code, run the simulations, and experiment with the implementations.
    <li>Refer to the README files within each project folder for specific usage instructions and explanations.
</ul>
