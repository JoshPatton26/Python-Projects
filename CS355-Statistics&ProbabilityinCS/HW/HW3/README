CS355 Probability and Statistics in CS: HW3 Poker Hand Simulator/Full House Counter

In this assignment I was tasked to create a program that would simulate a randomly drawn
5-card hand and to get the probability of getting a full house. My program was designed to
run 1000 iterations each generating a 5-card hand from 4 different arrays which represented
the different suit of the cards (Spade, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds). 

My program generated P(Full House) ~ 0.009% in a randomly drawn hand. 

To run this program you might have to pip install python's "random" library to get the program 
to function properly. I ran mine on VS Code however it shouldn't have any issues running on any 
other IDE, but hasn't been tested.
