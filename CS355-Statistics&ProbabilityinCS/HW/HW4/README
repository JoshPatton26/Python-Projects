CS355 Probability and Statistics in CS: HW4 Area Under the Curve/Riemann Sum Calculator

In this assignment I was tasked to create a program that would simulate the area under the 
curve of the function f(x) = sin(x) * cos(x) from 0 to 4pi. My approach was to use Riemann Sum 
method with the mid-point rule, to generate an approximation for this area. The instructions 
for this assignment clearly stated for us to consider all areas as positive areas which causes 
the answer to differ from a normal Riemann Sum calculator. In my program I allow the user to 
determine how many rectangles they want to use, the more rectangles the more precise on an 
approximation.

My program generated an area of ~ 3.99 when using 100 rectangles.

To run this program you might have to pip install python's "math" library to get the program 
to function properly, but shouldn't be necessary. I ran mine on VS Code however it shouldn't 
have any issues running on any other IDE, but hasn't been tested.
