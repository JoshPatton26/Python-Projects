CS355 Probability and Statistics in CS: HW7 Predicting Wait Times.

In this assignment I was tasked to create a program that would simulate the wait time for a 
person who takes a bus to get to work. The assignment gave us a range of discrete random 
variables of when the person shows up to the bus station which decides which bus the person 
will take to work. When the persons wait time will vary depending on the time they arrive to
the bus station. The assignment also wanted us to plot the wait times on a graph of frequency
vs. wait times using a Histogram graph.

To run this program you might have to pip install python's "numpy.random" and "matplotlib.pyplot" 
library to get the program to function properly. I ran mine on VS Code however it shouldn't 
have any issues running on any other IDE, but hasn't been tested.
